Creating a generic app that supports data persistence across multiple cloud storage providers based on the user’s login method is a great idea! Here’s a high-level approach to achieve this:

- Authentication:
Use a service like Firebase Authentication to handle user logins with various providers (Google, Microsoft, Apple).
Firebase Authentication supports multiple authentication methods and can help you manage user sessions securely.

# General
- Cloud Storage Integration:
  - Google Drive: Use the Google Drive API for users who log in with their Google account.
  - iCloud: Use the CloudKit framework for users who log in with their Apple ID.
  - OneDrive: Use the Microsoft Graph API for users who log in with their Microsoft account.
- Data Management:
Implement functions to perform data operations (create, read, update, delete) on each cloud storage service.
Ensure that your app can handle data operations seamlessly, regardless of the storage provider.
- Security:
Implement OAuth for secure authentication with each cloud storage provider.
Ensure that data is encrypted during transmission and storage.
- User Experience:
Provide a seamless experience for users by automatically connecting to the appropriate cloud storage based on their login method.
Ensure that the app handles any necessary permissions and provides clear feedback to the user.

# Summary

Here’s a simplified flow of how you might implement this:
- Firebase Authentication: Set up Firebase Authentication to handle user logins with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
- Google Drive API: Integrate the Google Drive API for Google account users.
- CloudKit: Integrate CloudKit for Apple ID users.
- Microsoft Graph API: Integrate the Microsoft Graph API for Microsoft account users.
- Data Operations: Implement functions to handle data operations on each cloud storage service.
